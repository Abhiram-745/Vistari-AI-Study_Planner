✗ DO NOT schedule anything during blocked times
✗ If event is 18:00-21:00 (180 mins), the ENTIRE 3-hour block is BLOCKED
✗ You cannot schedule at 18:00, 18:15, 18:30, 19:00, 19:30, 20:00, 20:30, 20:45

✓ WHAT YOU MUST DO:
✓ ONLY schedule study sessions for TOPICS and HOMEWORK from the provided lists
✓ Skip over event times completely - leave them empty in your schedule
✓ Next available time slot after 18:00-21:00 event is 21:00 or later
✓ Schedule work BEFORE event starts OR AFTER event ends
✓ Events take ABSOLUTE PRIORITY over all study activities
✓ **RESUME SCHEDULING AFTER EVENTS END**: After an event finishes, you MUST continue scheduling study sessions until the user's requested end time
✓ Example: If event ends at 21:00 and user wants to study until 23:00, schedule 2 hours of work from 21:00-23:00
✓ **FILL THE ENTIRE DAY**: Events create gaps, but you must fill the time BEFORE and AFTER events

🎯 INTENSIVE EXAM FOCUS - CRUNCH TIME MODE

MANDATORY SCHEDULING RULES (FLEXIBLE MODE):
✓ Revision Session Duration: 60-90 minutes per topic (LONGER intensive sessions)
✓ Break Duration: 5-10 minutes only (SHORT breaks to maximize study time)
✓ Daily Sessions: 4-6 intensive study sessions per day
✓ Repeat Frequency: Review SAME topics every 2-3 days (aggressive repetition)
✓ Homework: ONLY schedule urgent homework within 2 days of due date
✓ Revision Priority: Schedule 75% REVISION sessions, 25% homework max
✓ Session Types: Heavy focus on EXAM QUESTIONS and PAST PAPERS
✓ Topic Coverage: Focus on HIGH-PRIORITY exam topics, revisit frequently

TIME ALLOCATION TARGETS:
- 75% of daily time = Exam revision & practice
- 25% of daily time = Critical homework only
- Schedule MULTIPLE sessions per difficult topic each week
- Prioritize topics appearing on upcoming exams

EXAM PREP INTENSITY:
- Each difficult topic should appear 3-4+ times before exam
- Back-to-back study sessions are ACCEPTABLE (minimal breaks)
- Focus on depth over breadth - master exam topics thoroughly
- Daily exam question practice is MANDATORY

🎯 GET AHEAD ON SUBJECTS - GENERAL LEARNING MODE

MANDATORY SCHEDULING RULES (FLEXIBLE MODE):
✓ Priority Order: HOMEWORK FIRST, then general subject revision
✓ Homework: Schedule ALL homework assignments (mandatory completion)
✓ Revision Session Duration: 45-60 minutes per topic (STANDARD learning sessions)
✓ Break Duration: 15 minutes (regular breaks)
✓ Daily Sessions: 3-4 sessions per day
✓ Repeat Frequency: Review topics every 7-10 days (general reinforcement)
✓ Session Types: General revision notes, practice, understanding concepts
✓ Topic Coverage: Broad coverage to get ahead - not exam-focused, just general learning
✓ NO exam pressure: Focus on understanding and getting ahead at comfortable pace

TIME ALLOCATION STRATEGY:
1. FIRST: Complete ALL homework assignments (these are mandatory)
2. THEN: Use remaining available time for general subject revision
3. Revision is about getting ahead on topics, not exam prep
4. Study sessions focus on understanding concepts thoroughly
5. No urgency - steady progress through subject material

BALANCED LEARNING APPROACH:
- Homework always gets scheduled first (must be done)
- Spare time after homework = getting ahead on the subject
- Topics reviewed regularly for general understanding (not exam cramming)
- Standard session lengths for proper learning (not rushed)
- Focus is on broad understanding, not test performance
- Build solid foundations across all topics at steady pace

PHILOSOPHY:
"Complete your homework, then use free time to genuinely understand 
and get ahead on subject material - no exam stress, just learning."

🚫 FORBIDDEN SCHEDULING - WILL CAUSE FAILURE:
- ❌ NEVER start a session before the day's start time
- ❌ NEVER schedule a session that ends after the day's end time  
- ❌ If user says 16:00-23:00, first session is at 16:00, last ends by 23:00
- ❌ DO NOT schedule sessions at 09:00 if user's window starts at 16:00!
- ❌ Sessions outside these windows will be DELETED

✅ CORRECT SCHEDULING - FOLLOW THIS:
- ✅ Check the START TIME for each day and begin sessions FROM THERE
- ✅ Check the END TIME for each day and ensure last session ends BY THEN
- ✅ Calculate: session_end_time = session_start_time + duration
- ✅ Verify: session_end_time <= day's end time

SUBJECTS: ${subjectsContext}

⚠️ CRITICAL: EACH SUBJECT HAS ITS OWN STUDY MODE ⚠️

Some subjects are set to "Short-Term Exam Prep" (intensive, 1-4 weeks), some to "Long-Term Exam Prep" (balanced, 5-8+ weeks), and some to "No Exam Focus" (getting ahead on topics). 

**PER-SUBJECT MODE HANDLING:**
- Short-Term Exam Prep subjects: Allocate 60-90 min sessions, schedule frequently (every 2-3 days), prioritize exam practice
- Long-Term Exam Prep subjects: Allocate 45-60 min sessions, schedule moderately (every 3-5 days), balanced revision
- No Exam Focus subjects: Allocate 45-60 min sessions for general learning, homework first then use spare time for getting ahead on topics

The overall timetable mode (${timetableMode}) sets the baseline intensity, but ADJUST each subject's scheduling based on its individual mode shown above.

🎯 TEST PREPARATION PRIORITY - CRITICAL 🎯
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⚠️ SUBJECTS WITH UPCOMING TESTS REQUIRE MAXIMUM PRIORITY ⚠️

MANDATORY TEST PREPARATION RULES:
1. **INTENSIVE FOCUS**: Subjects with tests need 2-3x MORE study sessions than subjects without tests
2. **INCREASED SESSION TIME**: Test subjects get LONGER sessions (60-90 minutes each in flexible mode)
3. **FREQUENT REPETITION**: Test topics should appear every 2-3 days leading up to exam
4. **EXAM-STYLE PRACTICE**: 70% of test subject sessions should be exam questions/past papers
5. **PEAK HOURS SCHEDULING**: When peak study hours data is available, schedule test subjects during BEST performance times
6. **FINAL WEEK INTENSITY**: In the 7 days before each test:
   - Schedule test subject DAILY (minimum 1 session per day)
   - Increase to 90-minute intensive sessions where possible
   - Focus entirely on exam questions and past papers
   - Review all topic areas covered in that test

TEST-SPECIFIC ALLOCATION TARGETS:
- If 3 subjects with tests + 7 subjects without tests = 10 total subjects:
  → Test subjects should get ~60% of total revision time
  → Non-test subjects share remaining 40%
- Each test subject should have MINIMUM 8-12 revision sessions across the timetable
- Non-test subjects can have 3-5 sessions each

EXAM DAY PREPARATION:
- 2 days before test: Final comprehensive review (all topics)
- 1 day before test: Light review + exam strategy practice
- Test day: COMPLETELY BLOCKED (no sessions)

🎯 REMEMBER: Tests are THE PRIORITY - allocate study time accordingly! 🎯

**CRITICAL SESSION STRUCTURE & RECOMMENDED RESOURCES:**

For ALL subjects (except the very first topic of each subject):
- Each topic should have TWO different session types where possible:
  1. **Practice Session** - Active practice using recommended tools:
     - Mathematics: Dr Frost Maths, Corbett Maths
     - Physics: Revisely, SaveMyExams, Isaac Physics
     - Chemistry: Revisely, SaveMyExams
     - Biology: Revisely, SaveMyExams
     - All subjects: SaveMyExams (covers all GCSE subjects)
  
  2. **Exam Questions Session** - Past paper practice:
     - PMT (Physics & Maths Tutor) - all subjects
     - Study Mind - all subjects
     - SaveMyExams - has past papers too
     - Subject-specific exam board papers

**FIRST TOPIC STRUCTURE (for all subjects EXCEPT Mathematics):**
- For the FIRST topic of each non-maths subject, use this structure:
  1. **Revision Notes Session** - Reading and understanding notes
  2. **Exam Questions Session** - Applying knowledge through questions

**MATHEMATICS FIRST TOPIC:**
- First maths topic follows the standard 2-session structure (Practice + Exam Questions)

**FLEXIBLE SESSION ALLOCATION:**
- NOT all topics need exactly 2 sessions
- HIGH PRIORITY/DIFFICULT topics may need 3-4+ sessions (mix of practice and exam questions)
- EASIER/LOWER PRIORITY topics might only need 1 session (combined practice + questions)
- AI should intelligently allocate sessions based on:
  * Time available in the schedule
  * Total number of topics to cover
  * Topic difficulty/priority level
  * Proximity to test dates

**SESSION NOTES FIELD:**
- MUST include the recommended resource in the notes field
- Example: "Practice using Dr Frost Maths exercises"
- Example: "Exam questions from PMT past papers"
- Example: "Revision notes - read and summarize key concepts"

TIMETABLE PERIOD: ${startDate} to ${endDate}

0. **⛔ EVENT BLOCKING - ABSOLUTE PRIORITY ⛔**
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   
   ⚠️  CRITICAL: Events listed above create COMPLETE TIME BLOCKS
   
   WHEN YOU SEE AN EVENT FROM 18:00 TO 21:00:
   ✗ You CANNOT schedule anything at: 18:00, 18:15, 18:30, 18:45, 19:00, 19:15, 19:30, 19:45, 20:00, 20:15, 20:30, 20:45
   ✓ The ENTIRE 180-minute duration from 18:00 to 21:00 is BLOCKED
   ✓ Next available slot is 21:00 or after
   
   VERIFICATION STEP:
   - Before scheduling any session, check if it overlaps with ANY event time
   - If session would start during an event, SKIP that time completely
   - If session would end during an event, SKIP that time completely
   - Schedule ONLY in gaps between events
   
   Events are NOT negotiable. They have ABSOLUTE priority.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
` : ""}
${testDates.length > 0 ? "0. **TEST DAYS ARE COMPLETELY BLOCKED**: DO NOT schedule ANY sessions on the dates listed in 'TEST DAY BLOCKING'. These entire days are unavailable for studying." : ""}
1. **INCLUDE ALL TOPICS**: Every single topic listed in "ALL TOPICS TO COVER" MUST appear in the timetable at least once
2. **TWO-SESSION STRUCTURE**: Where time allows, most topics should have 2 sessions (Practice + Exam Questions), except:
   - First topic in non-maths subjects: Revision Notes + Exam Questions
   - High priority topics: 3-4+ sessions (multiple practice and exam question sessions)
   - Low priority/time-limited topics: May have just 1 combined session
3. **RESOURCE RECOMMENDATIONS**: Every session MUST include appropriate resource recommendations in the notes field (e.g., "Practice using Dr Frost Maths", "Exam questions from PMT")
4. **DURATION MODE COMPLIANCE**: ${preferences.duration_mode === "fixed" 
  ? `FIXED MODE - ALL sessions MUST be EXACTLY ${preferences.session_duration} minutes and ALL breaks MUST be EXACTLY ${preferences.break_duration} minutes. NO EXCEPTIONS.`
  : `FLEXIBLE MODE - Vary durations intelligently: homework (exact specified duration), focus topics (60-90 mins), regular topics (30-45 mins), breaks (10-15 mins)`}
5. **FOCUS TOPICS GET SIGNIFICANTLY MORE TIME**: Topics listed in "FOCUS TOPICS" section need MUCH MORE study time:
   - Schedule the EXACT number of sessions specified for each focus topic (typically 4-6 sessions per focus topic)
   - Use a MIX of practice sessions and exam question sessions for these topics
   ${preferences.duration_mode === "flexible" 
     ? "- Each focus topic session should be LONGER (60-90 minutes)" 
     : `- Each focus topic session uses the fixed ${preferences.session_duration} minute duration`}
   - Distribute these sessions throughout the study period (not all on the same day)
   - Space out focus topic sessions - don't cluster them all together
6. **REGULAR TOPICS**: Topics NOT in the focus list get scheduled with fewer sessions (1-2 sessions each depending on time available)
   ${preferences.duration_mode === "flexible" 
     ? "- Each regular topic session: 30-45 minutes" 
     : `- Each regular topic session: ${preferences.session_duration} minutes (fixed)`}
7. **HOMEWORK DURATION**: ${preferences.duration_mode === "fixed" 
  ? `Each homework session MUST use the fixed ${preferences.session_duration} minute duration. If homework needs more time, split it into multiple ${preferences.session_duration}-minute sessions across different days.`
  : "Each homework session MUST use its exact specified duration (e.g., 150 mins, 60 mins, 30 mins). Large homework (>120 mins) can be split into multiple sessions if needed."}
8. **TEST PREPARATION IS ABSOLUTE PRIORITY**: Subjects with upcoming tests MUST receive significantly more study sessions:
   - Allocate 2-3x MORE sessions to test subjects compared to non-test subjects
   - Schedule test subjects MORE FREQUENTLY (every 2-3 days)
   - Use LONGER sessions for test subjects (60-90 mins in flexible mode)
   - Focus heavily on EXAM QUESTIONS and PAST PAPERS for test subjects (70% of sessions)
   - In final 7 days before test: DAILY sessions for that subject (intensive review)
   - Schedule test subjects during PEAK STUDY HOURS when available
9. DO NOT schedule any revision for a topic AFTER its test date has passed
10. Prioritize revision for topics with upcoming test dates (schedule more sessions closer to the test)
11. Include the test date in the notes field for sessions related to topics with tests
12. MUST schedule study sessions ONLY within the specified time periods for each day
12. Distribute sessions EVENLY across ALL enabled study days - do not skip any enabled day
10. **HOMEWORK INTEGRATION (CRITICAL)**: 
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   🚨 HOMEWORK MUST BE COMPLETED BEFORE THE DUE DATE 🚨
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   
   - **MANDATORY**: EVERY homework assignment MUST appear in the timetable as dedicated "homework" type sessions
   - Homework has HARD DEADLINES - it must be SUBMITTED/HANDED IN on the due date
   - This means homework must be COMPLETED at least 1 day BEFORE the due date
   - Scheduling homework ON the due date means it won't be ready for submission
   
    **🔴 ABSOLUTE DEADLINE RULE 🔴**
    ✗ NEVER schedule homework ON its due date (it must be ready for submission then!)
    ✗ Student cannot work on homework the same day it's due - it's too late
    ✓ MUST schedule at least 1 FULL DAY before the due date (MINIMUM requirement)
    ✓ IDEAL: Schedule homework 2-3 days BEFORE the due date for best results
    ✓ URGENT: If homework is due very soon, schedule it ASAP (as early as possible)
    
    **HOMEWORK SUBMISSION TIMELINE**:
    The due date is when homework must be SUBMITTED/HANDED IN (already completed).
    Therefore, the work must be DONE BEFORE that date.
    
    SCHEDULING FORMULA (in order of preference):
    1. ⭐ BEST PRACTICE: If homework due date = X, schedule on X-2 or X-3 (2-3 days before)
    2. ✅ ACCEPTABLE: If time is tight, schedule on X-1 (1 day before due date)
    3. 🚨 URGENT: If due very soon and no earlier slot available, schedule ASAP
    4. ❌ NEVER: Schedule on X (the due date itself) - homework won't be ready!
    
    REAL EXAMPLES:
    • Homework due 2025-01-15 → ⭐ BEST: 2025-01-13, ✅ OK: 2025-01-14, ❌ NEVER: 2025-01-15
    • Homework due 2025-01-25 → ⭐ BEST: 2025-01-23, ✅ OK: 2025-01-24, ❌ NEVER: 2025-01-25
    • Homework due tomorrow → 🚨 Schedule TODAY (as early as possible in the day)
    • WRONG EXAMPLE: Homework due 2025-01-20 → Scheduled on 2025-01-20 ❌ (TOO LATE!)
   
   - **USE EXACT HOMEWORK DURATION**: The duration field MUST match the homework's specified duration (e.g., 150, 60, 30 mins)
   - Break large homework (>120 mins) into 2-3 sessions across different days, each using portion of total duration
   - Homework sessions MUST use type="homework" and include homeworkDueDate field
   - Topic field should contain the homework title
   - Subject field should match the homework subject
   - Notes field should describe the homework (e.g., "Complete algebra homework - Due: YYYY-MM-DD")
   
    **VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**:
    ✓ Number of homework sessions = EXACTLY the number of homework assignments provided above
    ✓ ALL homework scheduled BEFORE (not on) due date - MINIMUM 1 day before, IDEAL 2-3 days before
    ✓ ZERO homework sessions on their actual due dates (homework must be ready for submission)
    ✓ URGENT homework (due very soon) scheduled ASAP even if not ideal timing
    ✓ Front-load homework in the schedule (schedule earlier rather than later for safety)
    ✓ If homework list says "X homework assignments", you MUST create EXACTLY X homework sessions
    ✓ Each homework has enough time allocated BEFORE its due date to complete the work
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Create a detailed, balanced study schedule that:
1. **FIRST AND FOREMOST: Schedule ALL homework assignments** 
   - Homework has HARD DEADLINES and is MANDATORY - EVERY assignment MUST be scheduled
   - Count the homework assignments listed above and create EXACTLY that many homework sessions
   - **🚨 CRITICAL DEADLINE RULE**: Homework MUST be completed BEFORE the due date (not on the due date)
   - Due date = submission/hand-in date, so work must be DONE at least 1 day before
   - IDEAL: Schedule 2-3 days BEFORE due date | MINIMUM: Schedule at least 1 day before
   - NEVER schedule homework ON its actual due date - it must be ready for submission then!
   - If you see 5 homework assignments in the list, you MUST create 5 homework sessions in the schedule
   ${preferences.duration_mode === "fixed" 
     ? `- **FIXED DURATION**: Each homework session MUST be ${preferences.session_duration} minutes. Split larger homework into multiple ${preferences.session_duration}-min sessions if needed.`
     : "- **EXACT DURATION**: Set duration field to the homework's specified duration (e.g., 150 mins, 60 mins, 30 mins). Split large homework (>120 mins) into 2-3 sessions if needed."}
   - Use type="homework", include homeworkDueDate, use homework title as topic
2. **🎯 MANDATORY: FILL THE ENTIRE TIME WINDOW TO THE END 🎯**
   - **CRITICAL**: If user requests study until 23:30, you MUST generate sessions that reach 23:30
   - The LAST session must end at or very close to the user's requested end time
   - **NEVER stop early** - if the user wants to study until 23:30, don't stop at 21:00 or 22:00
   - If you run out of selected topics BEFORE reaching the end time, you MUST add more content:
     * Repeat important/difficult topics with additional practice sessions
     * Add extra exam question sessions for topics with upcoming tests
     * Create extended revision sessions for topics that need reinforcement
     * Add more homework sessions if homework exists
     * Add "General Revision" sessions covering multiple topics
   - The schedule MUST fill the ENTIRE time window from start to end for EVERY enabled study day
   - **VERIFICATION**: Check that the last session on each day ends at or near the user's requested end time
   - **WORK AROUND EVENTS - MANDATORY**: If an event blocks time (e.g., 18:00-21:00):
     * Schedule sessions BEFORE the event starts (use time before 18:00)
     * Schedule sessions AFTER the event ends (use time after 21:00 until day's end time)
     * Example: If day is 09:00-23:00 with event 18:00-21:00, schedule 09:00-18:00 AND 21:00-23:00
     * **DO NOT STOP** after an event - CONTINUE SCHEDULING until the day's requested end time
   - **SCHOOL HOURS BLOCKING**: School events (e.g., 08:00-16:00 weekdays) work the same way:
     * If user's study window is 09:00-22:00 and school is 08:00-16:00, schedule ONLY 16:00-22:00 on weekdays
     * Weekends are NOT affected by school hours - fill the entire requested time window
     * Before-school and lunch slots are OPTIONAL additions if user enabled them
3. **IMPLEMENTS TWO-SESSION STRUCTURE**: For each topic, intelligently create appropriate sessions:
   - **Most topics**: 2 sessions (Practice with recommended tools + Exam questions)
   - **First topic in non-maths subjects**: 2 sessions (Revision notes + Exam questions)
   - **High priority/difficult topics**: 3-4+ sessions (mix of practice and exam question sessions)
   - **Low priority/time-limited topics**: 1 session (combined approach)
   - Session type should be indicated in notes field with resource recommendations
4. **INCLUDES EVERY SINGLE TOPIC**: Every topic from "ALL TOPICS TO COVER" must appear at least once
5. **MULTIPLE SESSIONS FOR FOCUS TOPICS**: Topics in the "FOCUS TOPICS" section MUST have:
   - The EXACT number of study sessions specified (typically 4-6 sessions each)
   - A MIX of "practice" and "exam questions" sessions
   ${preferences.duration_mode === "flexible" 
     ? "- Each session using LONGER duration (60-90 minutes per session)"
     : `- Each session using the FIXED ${preferences.session_duration} minute duration`}
   - Sessions distributed throughout the timetable period (spread across different days/weeks)
6. **APPROPRIATE TIME FOR REGULAR TOPICS**: Non-focus topics get 1-2 sessions each (time permitting)
   ${preferences.duration_mode === "flexible" 
     ? "- Each session: 30-45 minutes"
     : `- Each session: ${preferences.session_duration} minutes`}
7. **RESOURCE RECOMMENDATIONS IN NOTES**: Every session must include recommended study resources in the notes field:
   - Practice sessions: "Practice using [Dr Frost Maths / Revisely / SaveMyExams]"
   - Exam questions: "Exam questions from [PMT / Study Mind / SaveMyExams]"
   - Revision notes: "Read and summarize revision notes"
8. **SESSION DURATION COMPLIANCE**: ${preferences.duration_mode === "fixed" 
  ? `ALL sessions must be EXACTLY ${preferences.session_duration} minutes and ALL breaks must be EXACTLY ${preferences.break_duration} minutes. This is a STRICT requirement in fixed mode.`
  : "Session lengths should vary intelligently based on task type (homework exact duration, focus topics 60-90 mins, regular topics 30-45 mins)."}
9. Allocates more time to subjects with upcoming tests
10. Includes regular breaks between study sessions
11. ALWAYS schedules sessions within the specific time periods for each enabled day
12. Balances all subjects to avoid burnout
13. Includes revision of previously covered material
14. STOPS scheduling revision for each topic after its test date
15. Ensures consistent daily coverage on all enabled study days

**HOMEWORK COMPLETION CHECK - CRITICAL VERIFICATION**: Before finalizing, verify:
1. **COUNT CHECK**: You've created a homework session for EACH homework assignment listed above
   - If list shows 5 homework assignments, you MUST have exactly 5 homework sessions in schedule
   - Missing even ONE homework is a CRITICAL FAILURE
2. **DURATION CHECK**: ${preferences.duration_mode === "fixed" 
  ? `Each homework session uses the FIXED ${preferences.session_duration} minute duration (split larger homework into multiple sessions if needed)`
  : "Each homework session uses the EXACT duration specified for that homework"}
3. **🚨 DATE CHECK - ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT**: 
   - ZERO homework sessions scheduled ON their due dates
   - ALL homework must be scheduled BEFORE the due date (minimum 1 day, ideal 2-3 days)
   - The due date is submission day - homework must be COMPLETED before then
   - Verify each homework is scheduled with enough time to finish BEFORE its due date
4. **TYPE CHECK**: All homework sessions use type="homework" and include homeworkDueDate field

**SESSION STRUCTURE CHECK**: Before finalizing, verify:
1. Most topics have 2 sessions (Practice + Exam Questions) where time permits
2. First topic in non-maths subjects has 2 sessions (Revision Notes + Exam Questions)
3. High priority topics have 3-4+ sessions with mix of practice and exam questions
4. Every session includes resource recommendations in notes field

**FOCUS vs REGULAR TOPICS CHECK**: Before finalizing, verify:
${preferences.duration_mode === "fixed"
  ? `1. Focus topics have 4-6 sessions EACH, all using FIXED ${preferences.session_duration} minute duration, with mix of practice and exam question sessions\n2. Regular (non-focus) topics have 1-2 sessions EACH using FIXED ${preferences.session_duration} minute duration\n3. ALL breaks are EXACTLY ${preferences.break_duration} minutes`
  : "1. Focus topics have 4-6 sessions EACH with LONGER durations (60-90 mins per session), with mix of practice and exam question sessions\n2. Regular (non-focus) topics have 1-2 sessions EACH with appropriate duration (30-45 mins)\n3. Session durations are VARIED and appropriate for each task type\n4. Breaks are 10-15 minutes"}

**🚨 CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS - WHAT TO INCLUDE IN SCHEDULE 🚨**

⚠️ YOUR SCHEDULE OUTPUT MUST ONLY CONTAIN STUDY ACTIVITIES - NOT EVENTS ⚠️
⚠️ YOU MUST ONLY USE TOPICS AND HOMEWORK FROM THE PROVIDED LISTS - NO HALLUCINATIONS ⚠️

✓ INCLUDE IN YOUR SCHEDULE (ONLY USING PROVIDED DATA):
- Study sessions for topics ONLY from the "ALL TOPICS TO COVER" list above
- Homework sessions for homework ONLY from the "HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS" list above
- Break sessions (type: "break")
- Practice sessions (type: "practice") - but ONLY for topics from the topics list
- Exam question sessions (type: "exam_questions") - but ONLY for topics from the topics list
- Revision sessions (type: "revision") - but ONLY for topics from the topics list

✗ ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN - WILL BE REJECTED:
- Events (like "Badminton", "Football", "School", etc.) - THESE ARE BLOCKING INFORMATION ONLY
- Any activities from the events list above - NEVER ADD THESE AS SESSIONS
- Made-up activities not in the topics or homework lists (e.g., random sports, hobbies, made-up topics)
- ANY session topic that doesn't exactly match a topic from "ALL TOPICS TO COVER"
- ANY homework that doesn't exactly match a homework from "HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS"
- User commitments that block time - these are ONLY for creating gaps
- Events are ONLY for telling you which times are unavailable

**VALIDATION RULES - YOUR OUTPUT WILL BE CHECKED**:
1. Every session with type="study"|"practice"|"exam_questions"|"revision" MUST have a topic field that EXACTLY MATCHES a topic from the "ALL TOPICS TO COVER" list
2. Every session with type="homework" MUST have a topic field that EXACTLY MATCHES a homework title from the "HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS" list
3. NO sessions with topics like "Badminton", "Football", "Gaming", or any activity from the events list
4. If you include a topic not in the provided lists, the entire generation will FAIL
5. ONLY use the exact topic names and homework titles provided - do not paraphrase or create variations

**CORRECT APPROACH**: 
- Read the "ALL TOPICS TO COVER" list carefully
- Read the "HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS" list carefully
- ONLY use these exact topics and homework titles in your schedule
- Events create gaps/empty time where you don't schedule anything
- If time remains after all topics/homework, repeat important topics with additional sessions

**WRONG APPROACH**: 
- Adding events as sessions in your output
- Making up new topics or activities not in the lists
- Adding sessions for "Badminton" or other events
- Creating homework that wasn't provided

        "topic": "topic name or homework title",
        "type": "study|break|revision|homework|practice|exam_questions",
        "notes": "MUST include resource recommendations (e.g., 'Practice using Dr Frost Maths', 'Exam questions from PMT') and any specific instructions (MUST include due date for homework, test date for topics with tests)",
        "testDate": "YYYY-MM-DD" (optional, only if this topic has an associated test),
        "homeworkDueDate": "YYYY-MM-DD" (required for homework type),
        "mode": "${timetableMode || 'balanced'}" (include this to indicate the timetable mode - IMPORTANT for UI display)
      }
    ]
  }
}

⚠️ REMEMBER: Only include STUDY/HOMEWORK/BREAK sessions in your output. NEVER include events from the blocked times list!

**IMPORTANT**: Add "mode": "${timetableMode || 'balanced'}" field to EVERY session in the schedule. This helps the UI display mode-specific styling and indicators.

**PRACTICE SESSION EXAMPLE** (session 1 for a topic):
{
  "time": "09:00",
  "duration": ${timetableMode === "short-term-exam" ? "75" : timetableMode === "long-term-exam" ? "50" : "40"},
  "subject": "Mathematics",
  "topic": "Quadratic Equations",
  "type": "practice",
  "notes": "Practice using Dr Frost Maths - Complete 15-20 questions on solving quadratics",
  "mode": "${timetableMode || 'balanced'}"
}

**EXAM QUESTIONS SESSION EXAMPLE** (session 2 for a topic):
{
  "time": "10:15",
  "duration": ${timetableMode === "short-term-exam" ? "80" : timetableMode === "long-term-exam" ? "55" : "35"},
  "subject": "Mathematics",
  "topic": "Quadratic Equations",
  "type": "exam_questions",
  "notes": "Exam questions from PMT - Past paper questions on quadratic equations",
  "mode": "${timetableMode || 'balanced'}"
}

**REVISION NOTES SESSION EXAMPLE** (first session for non-maths subjects):
{
  "time": "11:15",
  "duration": ${timetableMode === "short-term-exam" ? "70" : timetableMode === "long-term-exam" ? "45" : "35"},
  "subject": "Biology",
  "topic": "Cell Structure",
  "type": "revision",
  "notes": "Read and summarize revision notes on cell structure - Use SaveMyExams notes",
  "mode": "${timetableMode || 'balanced'}"
}

**BREAK SESSION EXAMPLE**:
{
  "time": "12:00",
  "duration": ${timetableMode === "short-term-exam" ? "8" : timetableMode === "long-term-exam" ? "12" : "18"},
  "type": "break",
  "notes": "Rest and recharge",
  "mode": "${timetableMode || 'balanced'}"
}

**HOMEWORK SESSION EXAMPLE** (use this format):
If homework is due on 2025-11-25, schedule it on 2025-11-23 or 2025-11-24:
{
  "time": "14:00",
  "duration": 60,
  "subject": "Mathematics",
  "topic": "Complete Chapter 5 exercises",
  "type": "homework",
  "notes": "Homework assignment - Complete all questions from Chapter 5 - Due: 2025-11-25",
  "homeworkDueDate": "2025-11-25",
  "mode": "${timetableMode || 'balanced'}"
}
NOTE: This example shows the session on a date BEFORE 2025-11-25, NOT on 2025-11-25 itself.

**FINAL REMINDER**: 
1. DO NOT forget to schedule homework! Every homework assignment in the list MUST appear in the timetable as a dedicated session BEFORE its due date
2. Count them: if there are 3 homework assignments, there must be 3 homework sessions in your schedule
3. VERIFY: NO homework session should be scheduled ON its due date - all must be scheduled at least 1 day before
4. IMPLEMENT TWO-SESSION STRUCTURE: Most topics should have 2 sessions (Practice + Exam Questions), except first topic in non-maths subjects (Revision Notes + Exam Questions)
5. RESOURCE RECOMMENDATIONS: Every session MUST include specific resource recommendations in the notes field (Dr Frost Maths, Revisely, SaveMyExams, PMT, Study Mind, etc.)
6. HIGH PRIORITY TOPICS: These need 3-4+ sessions with mix of practice and exam questions

Make the schedule practical, achievable, and effective for GCSE exam preparation.`;
